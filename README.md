Then run "npm install" || "npm i" concurrently node package with install all node packages for the server and client. 

Next go into /server then /utils

create a file called key.js the file should hold 

const keySecret = '(put something here)';
module.exports = keySecret;

The .gitignore file will make sure you only save that locally for when the repo is launched publicly the key or past key for authentication wont be saved.

To start the application to test if everything is working properly, have your command prompt at the root and run "npm run start:dev"
